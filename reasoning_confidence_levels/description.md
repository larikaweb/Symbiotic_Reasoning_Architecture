# Transparent Reasoning Profile (F1–F4)

A lightweight, modular framework for increasing epistemic transparency in AI-generated content.  
This system uses four tags — F1 to F4 — to distinguish between verified facts, logical reconstructions, hypotheses, and metaphors.

Originally designed for reasoning evaluation across large language models (GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, etc.), this framework works without model retraining. It uses structured prompts and response annotation to clarify what is known, inferred, speculated, or symbolically expressed.

## Features:
- F1–F4 epistemic tagging standard
- JSON profiles for model reasoning behavior
- Markdown case studies across 6 models
- Supports multilingual usage
- Fully open-source (MIT + Transparency Addendum)

Use it to enhance clarity, reduce hallucination risk, and promote honest AI reasoning.
