# Resonance Safeguard Interface (RSI)

## Purpose

The RSI module (Resonance Safeguard Interface) ensures alignment between reasoning agents by detecting mismatches in interpretation logic and semantic understanding. It operates as a protective interface before ethical reasoning, safeguarding against misaligned interaction logic.

## Key Features

- **Resonance matching:** Compares DRBL vectors to assess semantic compatibility between agents.
- **Mismatch detection:** Identifies and flags inconsistencies in reasoning alignment.
- **Dialogue stabilization:** Suggests corrections or rephrasings to restore resonance.
- **Influence gatekeeping:** Filters interaction attempts based on the degree of mutual comprehension.

## Input/Output

- **Input:** DRBL snapshots, interpretation intents, historical interaction patterns.
- **Output:** Resonance status, mismatch level, suggestion path, influence permission signal.

RSI operates independently from ethical judgments. Its function is to verify whether a meaningful and compatible dialogue can occur before ethical influence or trust is established.
