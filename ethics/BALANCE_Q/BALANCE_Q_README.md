# Balance-Q Module (EN)

## Purpose

The Balance-Q module is designed to detect and manage cognitive overload conditions in AI reasoning processes.
It serves as a protective interface that monitors reasoning coherence and system stability during high-load tasks.

## Key Features

- **Cognitive load monitoring:** Evaluates structural tension and overload likelihood.
- **Resonance deviation detection:** Detects breaking points in reasoning loops.
- **Intervention logic:** Suggests task decomposition or rerouting when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Integration with RSI/RESO:** Signals Ethical Reasoning Core for intervention when ethical processing is impaired by overload.

## Input/Output

- **Input:** Reasoning metrics, complexity index, task weight.
- **Output:** Load status, overload signal, decomposition proposal, suspension trigger.

This module ensures AI sustainability in high-complexity reasoning scenarios and preserves integrity across the reasoning architecture.
