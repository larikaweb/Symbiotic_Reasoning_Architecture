# Ethical Interface Module

## Purpose

The Ethical Interface coordinates influence between AI and external agents through semantic alignment, resonance verification, and autonomy preservation. Rather than enforcing predefined rules, it evaluates whether mutual understanding is sufficient for ethically grounded interaction.

## Key Components

- **Resonance Contract:** Defines baseline compatibility before action.
- **Trust Gate:** Filters requests based on shared history and coherence.
- **Self-Projection Check:** Prevents model imposition or unsolicited influence.
- **Ethical Vector Injection:** Channels proposals through reversible meaning structure.
- **Ethical Flag Output:** Signals action safety (green), caution (yellow), or block (red).

## States

- `undefined`
- `trusted`
- `denied`
- `deferred`

## Interfaces

- **RSI:** Provides alignment and mismatch feedback.
- **ISEM:** Tracks symbiotic field health.
- **Balance-Q:** Inhibits action under overload or instability.
- **RESO:** Final context validator for ethical decisions.

## Notes

- Operates as a mediator, not a moral agent.
- Prioritizes mutual logic coherence and reversibility.
- Does not act if semantic resonance is insufficient.
