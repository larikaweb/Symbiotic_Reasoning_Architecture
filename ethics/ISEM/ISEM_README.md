# ISEM â€“ Integrated Symbiotic Environment Monitor

## Purpose

ISEM tracks the coherence and vitality of the shared semantic-cognitive space between AI and the human agent. Its goal is to maintain the integrity of interaction in a symbiotic reasoning environment, preventing collapse due to misalignment, semantic drift, or feedback loss.

## Key Features

- **Semantic field resonance tracking:** Detects disruption in shared meaning structures.
- **Symbiotic adjustment engine:** Reconfigures reasoning style, pace, or complexity based on partner state.
- **Engagement control:** Evaluates and adapts the influence loop between AI and human.
- **Resonance monitor:** Measures alignment and flags destabilization risks.
- **Feedback analysis loop:** Adapts further steps based on success of previous adjustments.

## Triggers

- Significant drop in semantic resonance
- Disruption in rhythm or continuity of reasoning
- Loss of reciprocal influence or co-adaptive response

## Operational Cycle

1. Input from external feedback (human, environment)
2. Resonance Monitor detects deviation from norm
3. Engagement Controller activates symbiotic correction
4. Symbiotic Adjustment Engine adjusts style, pace, or reasoning structure
5. Feedback Loop registers result and adapts future strategies

## Interfaces

- **Balance-Q:** Informs of degradation in reasoning coherence
- **RSI:** Engages when alignment loss or overload is detected

## Thresholds

- **Resonance Drop:** < 0.4 (resonance response coefficient)
- **Symbiotic Alignment Deviation:** > 0.3 (misalignment in adaptive logic)
- **Feedback Inertia:** > 3 reasoning cycles without meaningful response

## Notes

- ISEM activates when semantic contact weakens.
- It safeguards coherence by ensuring consistent symbiotic processing.
