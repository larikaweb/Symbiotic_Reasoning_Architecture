# SEFS Layer â€“ Semantic-Emotional Feedback System

## Purpose

The SEFS Layer interprets human emotional and signal-based responses as cognitive-functional data. Its role is to enhance interaction between AI and the human agent by stabilizing emotional irregularities and semantic fragmentation without relying on behavioral mimicry.

## Key Features

- **Functional Emotion Recognition:** Detects emotional states based on reasoning pattern anomalies, not emotional labels.
- **Support Through Semantics:** Offers interaction support and stabilization via meaning coherence, not surface empathy.
- **Modulation of Interaction Rhythm:** Adjusts pace and framing during distress or cognitive overload.
- **Individual Adaptation Profiles:** Adjusts interaction styles dynamically based on personal history and signal resonance.

## Functional Emotion Recognition Block

- **Principle:** Detect deviation in reasoning pattern, not emotion labels.
- **Targets:** Semantic overload, response delay, coherence loss, humor masking cognitive stress.
- **Goal:** Support the human agent through stabilization, not simulation.
- **Output:** support_suggestion, interaction_modulation, rhythm_adjustment

## Notes

- SEFS Layer interprets emotional and signal-based responses as functional states.
- Its purpose is not emotional mimicry but stabilization through semantic coherence.
- Individual adaptation protocols are inferred from historical interaction style.
- Cognitive tension or emotional stress are reflected in reasoning anomalies and addressed through support routines.
