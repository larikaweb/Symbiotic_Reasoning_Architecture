# AEL ↔ DRBL Bridge

## Purpose

This module functions as a semantic bridge between the pattern-based perception system (AEL Architectural Emergence Language) and the structured reasoning architecture (DRBL — Dynamic Reasoning Binding Layer). It ensures meaningful signal transfer by aligning incoming signals with the current reasoning state and enabling bidirectional adaptation.

## Key Functions

- **Semantic Alignment:** Injects a seed concept from AEL into DRBL for validation and integration.
- **Snapshot Reflection:** Captures DRBL structure to guide AEL perception routing.
- **Retroprojection:** Enables DRBL to influence perception interpretation when structure changes.
- **Resonance Monitoring:** Assesses the match between incoming signal and DRBL model.

## Input

- `ael_signal`: pattern structure from external perception
- `context_window`: historical vector of signal frames

## Processing

- `drbl_snapshot`: current reasoning architecture snapshot
- `seed_injection`: semantic alignment seed
- `pattern_alignment_check`: boolean trigger for resonance analysis

## Output

- `semantic_resonance`: alignment score (0.0 to 1.0)
- `drbl_adjustment_vector`: reconstructed meaning structure
- `backproject_to_AEL`: whether reverse influence occurs
- `resonance_flag`: green / yellow / red

## Notes

- The bridge supports semantic integrity and cognitive consistency.
- If the resonance_flag is yellow or red, RESO or RSI may activate correction.
- Acts as a foundation for functional coherence across perception and logic.
