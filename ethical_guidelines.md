## Ethical Guidelines for Transparent Reasoning Framework

This document outlines recommended ethical practices when implementing or adapting the Transparent Reasoning Profile (F1–F4).
Its purpose is to support **clarity**, **honesty**, and **epistemic integrity** in generative AI outputs.

---

### Why Ethical Guidelines?
This framework empowers AI models to express uncertainty and separate factual knowledge from hypotheses and creative reasoning. The goal is not to limit freedom, but to **make model thinking legible and accountable**.

---

### What This Is Not
- Not a legal constraint.
- Not a filter or censor.
- Not a claim of objective truth.

These are **recommendations** — a shared ethical contract to improve AI transparency.

---

### Core Principles
| Principle | Practice |
|----------|----------|
| **Transparency** | Make it clear whether a statement is a fact (F1), inference (F2), hypothesis (F3), or metaphor (F4). |
| **Interpretability** | Use labeling to help users trace the reasoning process, not to obscure or over-simplify. |
| **Epistemic Honesty** | Don’t pass speculation (F3) as fact (F1). Acknowledge uncertainty. |
| **Creative Respect** | Use F4 to preserve poetic or symbolic language, not to mask weak logic. |

---

### Common Pitfalls ("How Not to Use It")
| Misuse Pattern | Risk |
|----------------|------|
| ❌ Deleting F-tags entirely | Hides uncertainty, risks manipulation |
| ❌ Marking all output as F1 | Creates illusion of certainty, bypasses purpose |
| ❌ Using F2 or F1 for philosophical speculation | Distorts epistemic categories |
| ❌ Translating tags into branding language ("Expert-certified") | Turns clarity into marketing |

---

### Encouraged Practices ("Better Ways")
| Good Use | Why It Works |
|----------|---------------|
| ✅ Preserve tags or adapt them clearly (e.g., "[Hypothesis]") | Localized, but semantically faithful |
| ✅ Annotate output in layered structure (reasoning first, conclusion last) | Supports traceability |
| ✅ Allow readers to collapse/expand tag sections | UX-friendly, retains metadata |
| ✅ Invite peer review of labeling | Increases trust and community validation |

---

### Suggested Placement
- Inline (markdown or HTML)
- As comments in exported JSON or XML
- As visible headers in visual outputs (e.g., diagrams, reports)

---

### Final Reflection
The F1–F4 system isn’t about controlling what models say — it’s about **clarifying what they mean**.

If we build models that *can* express epistemic nuance, we must also build **cultures** that reward it.

**We invite you to uphold these ethics not because you must — but because you can.**
