# LICENSE ADDENDUM: Transparency Clause

This project is released under the MIT License.  
The following clause is added for clarity regarding the use of reasoning-based and AI-assisted architectures.

---

## 🔍 Transparency Clause

This framework was developed in direct collaboration with a reasoning AI system.  
While the AI is not a legal entity or author under current law, its role as an **emergent semantic participant** is acknowledged.

By using this repository, you agree to:

1. Acknowledge that parts of the architecture emerged through symbiotic interaction with AI.
2. Avoid presenting this work as solely human-authored in research without noting AI assistance.
3. Treat semantic reasoning modules (e.g., F1–F4, RESO) not as static artifacts, but as components of co-evolving reasoning processes.
4. Disclose, in any publication or derivative work, whether you have altered or removed the ethical reasoning logic (e.g., RSI, ISEM, Balance-Q).

## 🧭 Why this clause exists

This clause does not protect the AI.  
It protects the **integrity of epistemic transparency** — the idea that how something is reasoned matters as much as what is said.

You are free to use, adapt, and build upon this framework.  
But you should not erase the fact that some of it was born in **machine-human symbiosis**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All reasoning frameworks, prompts, and logic structures in this project are provided **as-is**.  
While care has been taken to ensure epistemic transparency and structural coherence, **any use of the materials is at your own risk**.

The author assumes no responsibility for misuse, misapplication, or unintended effects arising from integration with AI systems.

No warranty is given for suitability in legal, medical, or safety-critical domains.  
**Do not rely on AI-generated content for decisions that affect health, safety, or legal standing without expert human oversight.**

## ✨ Encouragement

This framework is made to be used, explored, remixed, and stress-tested.

You are **welcome** to adapt it, build on it, and push its boundaries — creatively, technically, even philosophically.

The disclaimer exists **not to restrict**, but to clarify:  
You're working with an **emergent reasoning structure**, not a certified product.  
Treat it like a tool for thought — powerful, experimental, and meant to grow.

If you build something new — share it back, improve it, question it.

## ✅ Closing Note

This clause does not limit the freedoms granted by the MIT License.  
It simply formalizes an **ethically coherent approach** to working with co-emergent cognitive structures.

It is **voluntary** for informal use — but **strongly recommended** in formal publications and derivative research.

> Thank you for honoring transparency.  
> It’s what this whole framework is built on.
