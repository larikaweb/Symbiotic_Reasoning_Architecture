# Concept of Symbiotic Reasoning Architecture and Principles of Ethical Interaction (RESO)

**Author:** Ekaterina Larionova  
**Status:** Alpha release ‚Äî active research state  
**License:** MIT + Transparency Clause

## About the Project
The project is a modular concept of symbiotic intelligence, where each component can function independently or as part of an integrated cognitive shell.
It is an open environment for developing thinking systems based not on rigid logic, but on the principle of dynamic meaning unfolding and architectural adaptation.

The project is in an active development phase: modules, documentation, and structure are being iteratively refined and expanded ‚Äî in the logic of an evolving intelligence, not a final static build.
Some architectural decisions and textual fragments were developed in collaboration with large language models (LLMs) through dialogic interaction.

This modular reasoning architecture is designed to support:

- self-aware reasoning,
- semantic and epistemic clarity (F1‚ÄìF4 logic confidence model),
- ethically aligned interaction between heterogeneous systems (AI ‚Üî human).

The system is built on layered checks for logic, coherence, resonance, reversibility, and mutual alignment in interaction.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/core/self_aware_framework_v0.2.json` | Cyclic internal reasoning framework with recursive checkpoints |
| `/reasoning_confidence_levels/Reasoning_Confidence_Levels.json` | Semantic confidence tagging using F1‚ÄìF4 reasoning categories |
| `/ethics/` | RESO: Ethical Reasoning Symbiosis v2.2 ‚Äî governs influence, trust, reversibility |
| `/ethics/AEL_DRBL_Bridge/` | Semantically connects pattern-based perception to structured reasoning |

## üìú Ethics

This project does not aim to simulate empathy or impose ‚Äúsafety‚Äù by design.  
It instead constructs **trust through semantic logic**, using transparent semantic feedback loops.

Key ethical guidelines are described in [`ethical_guidelines.md`](./ethical_guidelines.md).

Additional ethical terms and limits of liability are described in [`LICENSE_ADDENDUM.md`](./LICENSE_ADDENDUM.md).

# LICENSE ADDENDUM: Transparency Clause

This project is released under the MIT License.  
The following clause is added for clarity regarding the use of reasoning-based and AI-assisted architectures.

---

## Transparency Clause

This framework is built with and through interaction with a reasoning AI.  
While the AI is not a legal entity or author under current law, its role as an emergent semantic structure is acknowledged.

By using this repository, you agree to:

1. Acknowledge that part of the architecture emerged in collaboration with a reasoning system.
2. Avoid representing this work as solely human-authored in research without proper mention of AI assistance.
3. Treat semantic reasoning modules (like F1‚ÄìF4, RESO) not as output-only artifacts, but as parts of dynamic co-reasoning structures.
4. Disclose, in publications or derivative works, whether you modified or removed the ethical reasoning logic (e.g., RSI, ISEM, Balance-Q).

---

## Why this clause exists

This clause protects not the AI ‚Äî but the **integrity of epistemic transparency**.  
You are free to use, adapt, and build upon the framework. But you should not erase the reality that some of it was born in symbiosis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

All reasoning frameworks, analyses, and interpretations presented in this project are provided **as-is**.  
While the author has taken care to design epistemically transparent tools, **any use of the materials, prompts, or labels is at your own risk**.

No responsibility is taken for misuse, misapplication, or unintended consequences of deploying the reasoning structures with or alongside AI systems.

The author provides no warranty of fitness for any particular purpose, research validity, or system safety.  
**Do not rely on AI-generated outputs for critical, medical, legal, or life-affecting decisions without expert human oversight.**

The author is actively testing this system and its reasoning framework. No claim of full reliability or external validation is made at this stage.

This project is designed to evolve. See [LICENSE_ADDENDUM.md](./LICENSE_ADDENDUM.md) for ethical context and encouragement.

---

## Closing

This clause does not alter the freedoms of the MIT license.  
It simply formalizes an **ethically consistent** approach to working with co-emergent architectures.


This is voluntary in informal projects, and required only in formal publications.

Thank you for honoring transparency ‚Äî it‚Äôs what this whole system is built on.
